# Nuketown Zombies [Mod-Friendly] - Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 Steam Workshop

Welcome to the repository of the **Nuketown Zombies map source code**, published on the Steam Workshop for **Call of Duty: Black Ops 3**. This repository is designed to allow modders to make changes to the map using this code as a base.

Important: This repository contains only the source code/scripts.
It does not include the compiled map or any Workshop files.

## Repository Purpose

This repository provides modders the opportunity to:

- Modify the **Nuketown Zombies** map.
- Enhance functionalities by adding new features.
- Experiment with scripts and configurations to expand the gameplay experience.

If you wish to modify the map, **it is essential to integrate all the scripts included in this repository** into your mod to ensure optimal compatibility.

Scope & Version

Important: This repository applies only to the new Workshop upload of the map:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3558354570

It does not apply to the legacy 2020 version of Nuketown Zombies. That older release is not modifiable because the original source files are no longer available.

## Preliminary Note

**Important:** This source code is mostly derived from an older version published on the Steam Workshop. At the time, I was just starting out with programming, so **some parts of the code might be difficult to understand** or modify. I apologize in advance for any challenges you may face during your modifications.

## Compatibility

If the **Nuketown Zombies** map has been updated on Steam since this repository was released, it is **strongly recommended** to import the changes from this repository into your mod to ensure full compatibility with the latest version.

## Contact

If you encounter any issues or have questions about this repository or the script modifications, feel free to open an issue on this repository.

Thank you and happy modding!
